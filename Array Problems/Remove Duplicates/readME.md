# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

This C++ program provides a solution to remove duplicates from a sorted array. The solution is implemented as a class method `removeDuplicates` in the `Solution` class.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Leetcode.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the Leetcode directory
    cd Leetcode

    # Navigate to the Remove Duplicates directory
    cd Array2
    ```

3. Compile the program:

    ```bash
    g++ array2.cpp -o remove_duplicates
    ```

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./remove_duplicates
    ```

## Example Usage

The `main` function in `array2.cpp` demonstrates the usage of the `removeDuplicates` method. It includes two test cases with sorted arrays and prints the results to the console.
