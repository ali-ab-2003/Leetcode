# Search Insert Position

This is a simple C++ program that implements a function to find the position where a target element should be inserted in a sorted array. The code uses a linear search approach to locate the target element or determine the position for insertion.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Leetcode.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the Leetcode directory
    cd Leetcode

    # Navigate to the Array1 folder
    cd Array3
    ```

3. Compile the program:

    ```bash
    g++ array3.cpp -o search_insert
    ```

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./search_insert
    ```

## Example Usage

The `main` function in `array3.cpp` demonstrates the usage of the `searchInsert` method. It includes one test case with a sorted vector and prints the result to the console.
